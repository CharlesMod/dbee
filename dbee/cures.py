"""dbee.cures — what the doctor may do to a patient, and the shape every act keeps.

A cure is a command with an undo and a verify. Two sources:

* the **runbook** (``assets/runbook.jsonl``): named cures with a signature (which
  probe reads red), a script, an undo script and a verify probe. These are
  rules someone chose; the doctor runs one when its signature matches.
* a **written** cure: the mind names a command, its undo and a verify command.
  Allowed only inside the shape below; recorded (with its undo) before it runs.

The shape, held in code: a cure is one line of shell from the ``ALLOWED``
verbs; nothing in ``NEVER`` (the irreversible: wiping, reboots, filesystems,
devices, users, the doctor's own records); its undo is non-empty and passes the
same check; its verify is a read-only look (``looks.check``). What the shape
refuses is refused however the mind words it.
